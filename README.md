### Overview:
This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. Here we are focussing to use CNN to detect dog images.
	1) In this, the model should detect that the input image is of a dog or human or none of them. 
	2) If it is detected as dog, than detect the breed of dog.
	3) If it is detected as human, then detect the breed of dog which closely resemble to that image.


### Libraries:
	Keras
	OpenCV
	Matplotlib
	Numpy


### File Description:
	dog_app.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the algorithm and process used to create it.
	dog_app.html: A copy of dog_app.ipynb in html format.
	Haarcascades folder: Xml file for use with the OpenCv face detector class.
	Various images: Images in jpg and jpeg format used to test the algorithm's predictions.


### Results
	The algo is detecting dog image correctly.
	The algo is detecting human image correctly.
	The algo gave a 70.2153% test accuracy
